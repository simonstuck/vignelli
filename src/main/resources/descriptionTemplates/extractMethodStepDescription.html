<p>In this step we extract the statements that are affected by the train wreck into their own method:</p>
<table class="code">
    ${foreach elementsToExtract elem}
        <tr>
            <td>${elem}</td>
        </tr>
    ${end}
</table>
<p>At this stage you do not need to give the method any meaningful name. Naming the method will become easier at a later stage once this method is a member of the right class. For now, name your resulting method <span class="code">doAThing</span>.</p>
