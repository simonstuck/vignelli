<p>In this step we introduce a parameter for the following expression:</p>
<p class="code">${parameterElement}</p>
<p>Notice that this expression itself, although it may look like a train wreck, is not in fact one because the code is not asking for data repeatedly. We therefore introduce the part of the expression that is not a train wreck itself as a parameter so that it can remain in its original location in ${currentClass} while we will move this method to a new location in the next step.</p>
