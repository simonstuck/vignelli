<h1>Complex Method</h1>
<p>This method appears to complex. This is generally a problem of the semantic distance between what it does and how it does it.</p>
<p>In other words, it is difficult to understand the purpose of the method due to too many implementation details.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, try extracting parts of this method such as loops and/or <span class="code">if</span>-statements into their own subroutines.</p>
