<h2>What is a Train Wreck?</h2>
<blockquote cite="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TrainWreck">
    <p>The train wreck anti pattern occurs when a series of method calls are appended to one another all in one line of code. If you find yourself spending a lot of time reading through a series of method calls and trying to figure out what the line of code is actually doing, you probably are dealing with a train wreck.</p>
